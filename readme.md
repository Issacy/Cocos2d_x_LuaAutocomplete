## Cocos2d-x LuaAutocomplete

******

Edit from [LuaAutocmplete](https://github.com/ColonelThirtyTwo/LuaAutocomplete)  
support LuaExtended plugin

------

#### auto-completion added
* add cocos api(modules, class, class-method)
    * input `module` or `class` before an empty char or in a new line, will show cocos modules or classes in completions
    * input `class` after an module with dot, will show cocos classes of that module in completions
    * class-funcs
        * input specific class name follow ":", will show funcs that should use ":" to call in completions
        * input specific class name follow ".", will show funcs that should use "." to call in completions
* require path(folder & file in str content)
* file path(in str content)

------

#### configuration

Need configure the lua api files folder path(api files should generated by tolua), res folder and script folder in `Cocos2d_x_LuaAutocomplete.py`
When first open subl or reload plugins, type words first time will stuck a while to load api files

------

#### wish-list
* use a config file to configure vars above
* vars go with `.sublime-project`
* find a way to support more,  now api files generated by `tolua` is not the full version
    * miss some functions which supported by `manual.cpp`, not recorded
    * some defined in cocos lua framework(`script/cocos/*.lua` and so on)
* maybe use sqlite to store and get curtain completions to speed-up loading
* log file not used yet, may record some crashes into it

------

#### update log
* 20180524
    * support custom classes generated by `tolua`
    * all classes completions will insert into modules completions
